# EDCraft

EDCraft is a Minecraft mod that adds Electronic Digital Circuits components to the game.

This mod simplifies the creation of digital circuits in Minecraft, changing the way the player interacts with redstone. It is the perfect environment to learn about digital circuits and logic gates from the simplicity of Minecraft. It also serves as a tool to create complex redstone contraptions in a more compact and easier way.
